# pi-lcd

## summary

This program utilizes the [rpi-lcd](https://pypi.org/project/rpi-lcd/) library to display text on a 1602 LCD hooked up with an I2C module.

There's a few things built-in already with ```subprocess``` -- ping, RPi temp and memory, and others. This will later be its own file...

## schematics

coming soon

## TODO

- server w/ threading
- mute subprocess output on curl and netcat
- figure out HOW TO DISABLE THE BACKLIGHT PROGRAMMATICALLY (it's so bright) if possible
- break data grabs into separate file
